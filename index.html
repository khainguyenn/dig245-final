        <h2>What is Deceptive Design Quiz?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Deceptive Design Quiz</strong> is a project designed to educate users about deceptive design patterns used on commercial websites to manipulate user behavior. These patterns, though not always illegal, often exploit user trust to benefit businesses at the userâ€™s expense. The quiz aims to help users identify these practices, empowering them to make more informed decisions online.
        </p>
  
        <h2>How Does the Quiz Work?</h2>
        <p>
          The quiz presents real-world examples of deceptive design patterns, asking users to choose which design is manipulative. Correct answers include explanations of the tactics used, their impact, and tips to avoid falling for them. It covers concepts such as tricks to hide essential options, forcing undesired actions, making subscription cancellations difficult, hiding cheaper alternatives, and promising one thing but delivering another.
        </p>
  
        <h2>How Was It Made?</h2>
        <p>
          The quiz was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for structure, styling, and responsiveness. It replicates deceptive designs through visual examples and enhances user understanding with interactive explanations.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Who Made Deceptive Design Quiz?</h2>

          Created by Khai Nguyen, Spring 2024, as part of the DIG-245 Critical Web Design class at Davidson College, under the guidance of Prof. Owen Mundy, this project highlights the ethical implications of online design practices.
